- Remember that execstate's getcommittedstate is obtained from the task's readVersion
- isValidRead checks if it can be obtained from other Tx/snapshot, without preventing Tx from obtaining from its own localwrite
    - We don't care if a transaction reads what it has written, because that would create a self-edge, which is not allowed. It also doesn't affect others' dependency relationships, right?
    - Will this implementation cause inconsistency? Exceeding the read-write set: originally there was no A in the read location, only write A; but now I'm reading A again, which is different from the previous read-write set
        - Does reading something you've written again affect anything? No
    - **is_valid_read(...)** checks if it's in input_data || localWrite
    - **is_valid_write(...)** checks if it's in output_data
    - readVersions becomes input_data
    - writeVersions becomes output_data
- Our execstate should have a journal, each Tx will have a new one; we should also add snapshot and revert for our evm.call/create, because the call of a child contract may be reverted, but it doesn't affect the parent contract
- PrizeChain should be maintained separately, it shouldn't be placed in vcCache
