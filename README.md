# Octopus: A Parallel Execution Framework for Blockchain Systems

This repository contains the LaTeX source code for the research paper on Octopus, a novel parallel execution framework for blockchain systems that addresses the challenges of transaction execution bottlenecks.

## Abstract

Octopus introduces a systematic approach to resolve the trilemma of determinism, conflict minimization, and resource utilization in blockchain parallel execution through three synergistic innovations:
- Two-phase execution framework
- Multi-version state cache
- Pipeline-driven modular design
